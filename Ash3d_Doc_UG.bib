  abstract  = {A simple formulation of the boundary layer is developed for use in large-scale models and other situations where simplicity is required. The formulation is suited for use in models where some resolution is possible within the boundary layer, but where the resolution is insufficient for resolving the detailed boundary-layer structure and overlying capping inversion. Surface fluxes are represented in terms of similarity theory while turbulent diffusivities above the surface layer are formulated in terms of bulk similarity considerations and matching conditions at the top of the surface layer. The boundary-layer depth is expressed in terms of a bulk Richardson number which is modified to include the influence of thermals. Attention is devoted to the interrelationship between predicted boundary-layer growth, the turbulent diffusivity profile, ‘countergradient’ heat flux and truncation errors.

The model predicts growth of the convectively mixed layer reasonably well and is well-behaved in cases of weak surface heat flux and transitions between stable and unstable cases. The evolution of the modelled boundary layer is studied for different ratios of surface evaporation to potential evaporation. Typical variations of surface evaporation result in a much greater variation in boundary-layer depth than that caused by the choice of the boundary-layer depth formulation.},

The suggested eddy diffusivity and wind speed profiles compare adequately with those reported in the literature and observational data. The evaluation of the proposed dispersion model as well as an independent method, against data from diffusion experiments, showed a satisfactory physical behavior and a good overall statistical performance of each model.

  abstract  = {During volcanic eruptions, volcanic ash transport and dispersion models
	(VATDs) are used to forecast the location and movement of ash clouds
	over hours to days in order to define hazards to aircraft and to
	communities downwind. Those models use input parameters, called “eruption
	source parameters”, such as plume height H, mass eruption rate Ṁ,
	duration D, and the mass fraction m63 of erupted debris finer than
	about 4 or 63 μm, which can remain in the cloud for many hours or
	days. Observational constraints on the value of such parameters are
	frequently unavailable in the first minutes or hours after an eruption
	is detected. Moreover, observed plume height may change during an
	eruption, requiring rapid assignment of new parameters. This paper
	reports on a group effort to improve the accuracy of source parameters
	used by VATDs in the early hours of an eruption. We do so by first
	compiling a list of eruptions for which these parameters are well
	constrained, and then using these data to review and update previously
	studied parameter relationships. We find that the existing scatter
	in plots of H versus Ṁ yields an uncertainty within the 50% confidence
	interval of plus or minus a factor of four in eruption rate for a
	given plume height. This scatter is not clearly attributable to biases
	in measurement techniques or to well-recognized processes such as
	elutriation from pyroclastic flows. Sparse data on total grain-size
	distribution suggest that the mass fraction of fine debris m63 could
	vary by nearly two orders of magnitude between small basaltic eruptions
	( 0.01) and large silicic ones (> 0.5). We classify eleven eruption
	types; four types each for different sizes of silicic and mafic eruptions;
	submarine eruptions; “brief” or Vulcanian eruptions; and eruptions
	that generate co-ignimbrite or co-pyroclastic flow plumes. For each
	eruption type we assign source parameters. We then assign a characteristic
	eruption type to each of the world's 1500 Holocene volcanoes. These
	eruption types and associated parameters can be used for ash-cloud
	modeling in the event of an eruption, when no observational constraints
	on these parameters are available.},
