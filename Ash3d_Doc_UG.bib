  abstract  = {A simple formulation of the boundary layer is developed for use in large-scale models and other situations where simplicity is required. The formulation is suited for use in models where some resolution is possible within the boundary layer, but where the resolution is insufficient for resolving the detailed boundary-layer structure and overlying capping inversion. Surface fluxes are represented in terms of similarity theory while turbulent diffusivities above the surface layer are formulated in terms of bulk similarity considerations and matching conditions at the top of the surface layer. The boundary-layer depth is expressed in terms of a bulk Richardson number which is modified to include the influence of thermals. Attention is devoted to the interrelationship between predicted boundary-layer growth, the turbulent diffusivity profile, ‘countergradient’ heat flux and truncation errors.

The model predicts growth of the convectively mixed layer reasonably well and is well-behaved in cases of weak surface heat flux and transitions between stable and unstable cases. The evolution of the modelled boundary layer is studied for different ratios of surface evaporation to potential evaporation. Typical variations of surface evaporation result in a much greater variation in boundary-layer depth than that caused by the choice of the boundary-layer depth formulation.},

The suggested eddy diffusivity and wind speed profiles compare adequately with those reported in the literature and observational data. The evaluation of the proposed dispersion model as well as an independent method, against data from diffusion experiments, showed a satisfactory physical behavior and a good overall statistical performance of each model.

  abstract  = {During volcanic eruptions, volcanic ash transport and dispersion models
	(VATDs) are used to forecast the location and movement of ash clouds
	over hours to days in order to define hazards to aircraft and to
	communities downwind. Those models use input parameters, called “eruption
	source parameters”, such as plume height H, mass eruption rate Ṁ,
	duration D, and the mass fraction m63 of erupted debris finer than
	about 4 or 63 μm, which can remain in the cloud for many hours or
	days. Observational constraints on the value of such parameters are
	frequently unavailable in the first minutes or hours after an eruption
	is detected. Moreover, observed plume height may change during an
	eruption, requiring rapid assignment of new parameters. This paper
	reports on a group effort to improve the accuracy of source parameters
	used by VATDs in the early hours of an eruption. We do so by first
	compiling a list of eruptions for which these parameters are well
	constrained, and then using these data to review and update previously
	studied parameter relationships. We find that the existing scatter
	in plots of H versus Ṁ yields an uncertainty within the 50% confidence
	interval of plus or minus a factor of four in eruption rate for a
	given plume height. This scatter is not clearly attributable to biases
	in measurement techniques or to well-recognized processes such as
	elutriation from pyroclastic flows. Sparse data on total grain-size
	distribution suggest that the mass fraction of fine debris m63 could
	vary by nearly two orders of magnitude between small basaltic eruptions
	( 0.01) and large silicic ones (> 0.5). We classify eleven eruption
	types; four types each for different sizes of silicic and mafic eruptions;
	submarine eruptions; “brief” or Vulcanian eruptions; and eruptions
	that generate co-ignimbrite or co-pyroclastic flow plumes. For each
	eruption type we assign source parameters. We then assign a characteristic
	eruption type to each of the world's 1500 Holocene volcanoes. These
	eruption types and associated parameters can be used for ash-cloud
	modeling in the event of an eruption, when no observational constraints
	on these parameters are available.},

  title    = {Methods for Determining the Height of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer},

  number   = {UCRL-ID-133200},
  abstract = {The Atmospheric Release Advisory Capability (ARAC) is an operational emergency response program which provides real-time dose assessments of airborne pollutant releases. This report reviews methodologies for determining the height of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), which were investigated for use in the next generation of ARAC diagnostic and dispersion models. The ABL height, hABL, is an essential parameter in atmospheric dispersion modeling, controlling the extent of the vertical mixing of pollutants near the surface. Although eventually instrumentation (radiosonde, lidar, sodar, etc.) may provide accurate means for determining hABL, at present the availability of such data is too limited to provide a general capability for ARAC. The current operational ARAC diagnostic models use a fixed value of hABL for any given time. ARAC's new models support a horizontally-varying atmospheric boundary layer height, which is used to generate meteorological (mean wind, temperature, etc.) and turbulence fields. The purpose of the present work is to develop methods to derive the ABL height for all atmospheric stability regimes. One of our key requirements is to provide approaches which are applicable to routinely available data, which may be of limited temporal and spatial resolution. The final objective is to generate a consistent set of meteorological and turbulence or eddy diffusivity fields to drive the new ARAC dispersion model. A number of alternative definitions of the atmospheric boundary layer exist, leading to different approaches to deriving hABL. The definitions are based on either the turbulence characteristics of the atmosphere or the vertical structure of one or more meteorological variables. Most diagnostic analyses determine hABL from profiles of temperature or occasionally wind. A class of methods of considerable current interest are based on Richardson number criteria. Prognostic methods calculate the time evolution of the top of the ABL from a rate equation. A number of commonly used methods of both types are reviewed along with considerations on their applicability to various types of meteorological data and atmospheric conditions.},

  abstract = {Data from the FIFE experiment of the summer of 1987 are used to assess the diurnal and seasonal cycles of the surface energy budget and boundary layer in the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, which used the summer 1995 version of the Medium-Range Forecast model. The seasonal agreement is quite good, reflecting the improvements in land-surface parameterizations in recent years. Detailed studies, however, identify several places where still further improvements in model parameterizations are possible. Clear-sky shortwave absorption and cloudiness may be underestimated in this model as has been noticed in other global models. More frequent updates of the model cloud cover (currently every 3 h) would improve the land-surface interaction after the initial onset of precipitation. The model produces a realistic well-mixed boundary layer, but underestimates boundary layer deepening by entrainment. For much of the summer, precipitation is close to that observed: however, for a period in June and early July, the reanalysis model has excess precipitation, which comes from daytime interactions between the surface evaporation, boundary layer, and convection schemes. The model, which has a deep 2-m soil reservoir, has adequate soil moisture storage for several weeks without rain, although surface evaporative fraction fluctuates more strongly after rain than is observed. Surface evaporation is generally too high at night, especially in high winds. This analysis suggests several improvements to the model parameterizations, some of which have already been implemented in the operational MRF model.},

  abstract  = {An eight-level three-dimensional primitive equation model which includes a detailed boundary layer parameterization scheme has been used to describe the initiation and evolution of sea-breeze convergence patterns over south Florida as a function of the surface heat and momentum fluxes and of the large-scale synoptic forcing. A minimum grid spacing of 11 km was used. Model results are presented for several different initial conditions and the results, when compared against cumulus cloud and shower patterns, demonstrate that the dry sea-breeze circulations are the dominant control on the locations of thunderstorm complexes over south Florida on undisturbed days.

It is also shown that, in contrast to the differential roughness, the differential heating between land and water over south Florida is the primary determinant of the magnitudes of convergence. The values of surface roughness, however, indirectly influence convergence patterns by affecting the intensity of the vertical turbulent transport of heat and momentum.

It is found that the sea breeze over south Florida accumulates synoptic-scale moisture in the convergence zones, since the magnitudes of moisture convergence are relatively unaffected by evaporation from the ocean at least for a period of 10 hours or so.

The results of the numerical experiments suggest that, in order to properly interpret the results of the Experimental Meteorology Laboratory's cloud-merger seeding experiments over south Florida, an appreciation and understanding of the sea-breeze circulations are required.},

The results from this approach are compared with those from the local diffusion approach, which is the current operational scheme, and verified against FIFE observations during 9–10 August 1987. The comparisons between local and nonlocal approaches are extended to the forecast for a heavy rain case of 15–17 May 1995. The sensitivity of both the boundary layer development and the precipitation forecast to the tuning parameters in the nonlocal diffusion scheme is also investigated. Special attention is given to the interaction of boundary layer processes with precipitation physics. Some results of parallel runs during August 1995 are also presented.},
