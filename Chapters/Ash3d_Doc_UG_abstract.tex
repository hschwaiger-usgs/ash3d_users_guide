Atmospheric dispersal of volcanic ash represents the most widespread of volcanic
hazards and the hazard with the greatest potential for economic impact. The
economic effects of ash distribution were demonstrated during the 2010 eruption
of Eyjafjallaj\"okull volcano in Iceland, when flight cancellations and delays
throughout Europe caused billions of dollars in economic loss to airlines and
travelers \cite{Harris12}. This event also demonstrated that volcanic
hazards are not limited to areas near the volcano. Flight cancellations and
delays during the 2011 eruption of Puyahue/Cordon Caulle in Chile extended
halfway around the world to Australia and New Zealand, for example.
